# Advent of Code 2022
Hi ðŸ‘‹  I am participating in Advent of Code for this first time. My goals are to: 
- Complete all puzzles 
- Complete all problems in JavaScript (as opposed to Python, the language I am most comfortable in) to strengthen my JavaScript chops

I will be adding what I learn to [LEARNINGS.md](./LEARNINGS.md). I will not be doing the puzzles right as they get released, so I will not be competing for time on the leaderboard.
